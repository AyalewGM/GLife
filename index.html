                        <p> Mandelbrot set has a few mathematically fascinating properties. Its complicated structure demonstrates what mathematicians mean by chaos: points very close to each other can have dramatically different behavior, and around the edges of the set, itâ€™s basically impossible to predict whether a point is going to go one way or another. It also has surprising and interesting connections to other fractals called Julia sets. </p> Taken from scientific American Blog

                        <p>The game of life is the best-known two-dimensional cellular automaton, invented by John H. Conway and popularized in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column starting in October 1970. The game of life was originally played (i.e., successive generations were produced) by hand with counters, but implementation on a computer greatly increased the ease of exploring patterns.

The life cellular automaton is run by placing a number of filled cells on a two-dimensional grid. Each generation then switches cells on or off depending on the state of the cells that surround it. The rules are defined as follows. All eight of the cells surrounding the current one are checked to see if they are on or not. Any cells that are on are counted, and this count is then used to determine what will happen to the current cell.

1. Death: if the count is less than 2 or greater than 3, the current cell is switched off.

2. Survival: if (a) the count is exactly 2, or (b) the count is exactly 3 and the current cell is on, the current cell is left unchanged.

3. Birth: if the current cell is off and the count is exactly 3, the current cell is switched on. </p>

                        <p> Geaometry is the study of shapes and the spaces that contain them. in this course, we will study many different areas of geometry and their application to the visual arts- how they can help us to understand art and how they are used to create art. You will:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> learn about the properties of geometric shapes, particularly those used in art </li>
                            <li> analyze geometry that is usedin artwork </li>
                            <li> justify the use of geomtry in an art to support the intention of the artist and your response to the work</li>
                            <li>explain how the geomtry of an artwork contributes to the aethestic wholeness of the work</li>
                            <li> create your own art using geomtry</li>>
